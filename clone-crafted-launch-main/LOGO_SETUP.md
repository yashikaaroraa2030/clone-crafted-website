# Logo Setup Instructions

## Steps to Add Your Logo:

1. **Download the logo from OneDrive:**
   - Open this link: https://1drv.ms/b/c/c83b2e7f126e8cc6/IQDliul0k-G0SpRK0gzSxlOIAYLBj9VnRS5-t53pvjSu8VQ?e=Xz7PoV
   - Download the logo file

2. **Save it to the public folder:**
   - Rename the file to `logo.png` (or keep original name if it's already PNG/JPG/SVG)
   - Place it in: `clone-crafted-launch-main/public/logo.png`
   - Supported formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.svg`

3. **If your logo has a different name:**
   - Update the `src` attribute in `src/components/Header.tsx`
   - Change `/logo.png` to `/your-logo-name.png`

## Alternative: Use OneDrive Direct Link

If you want to use the OneDrive link directly, you'll need to:
1. Convert the OneDrive share link to a direct download link
2. Or use a service to convert it
3. Update the `src` in Header.tsx to the direct link

**Note:** OneDrive share links often don't work directly as image sources. It's recommended to download and use a local file.
